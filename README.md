## Prototype: Exhibition catalogue publication

Simon Worthington, [simon.worthington@tib.eu](mailto:simon.worthington@tib.eu), NFDI4Culture. Open Science Lab, TIB. 03.2024

Demo and code: [https://github.com/NFDI4Culture/CPS-Demo](https://github.com/NFDI4Culture/CPS-Demo)

## The service

Computational Publishing Service (CPS) uses Jupyter Notebooks to publish from cultural digital collections using Linked Open Data, and Wikidata and Wikibase. The service is designed to sit on top of existing NFDI4Culture Linked Open Data infrastructure.

Use cases: Digital Humanities scholars, cultural digital collections, and humanities publishing.

Value proposition: Provide a channel to audiences for cultural digital collections, enable reusable machine readable record of content used in publications, allow humanities publishers to integrate and support computational publications.

## The prototype

The goal is to demonstrate automated multi-format publishing – web, PDF, ePub Docx, and  interactive Jupyter Notebooks – of content from digital cultural collections stored as Linked Open Data (LOD) on Wikidata and Wikibase, and from other APIs and LOD sources.

The publications will be authored using Jupyter Notebooks used via the Google Colab platform, from GitHub storage, and rendered to multi-format using the Jupyter Notebook wrapper platform Quarto. The publication will be published to GitHub.

The content of the demo will be a fictional exhibition catalogue of a collection of paintings from the Corpus of Baroque Ceiling Painting in Germany (CbDD).
